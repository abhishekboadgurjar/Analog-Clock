## Introduction

Hello, fellow developers! Today, I'm thrilled to share a project I recently completed: an **Analog Clock**. This project is a visually appealing and interactive way to display time using a traditional analog clock face. It's an excellent project for honing your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills, particularly in working with animations, DOM manipulation, and time-based functions. Whether you're a beginner looking to practice or an experienced developer wanting to create a classic clock interface, this project is a great choice.

## Project Overview

The **Analog Clock** is a real-time clock that mimics the appearance and functionality of a traditional analog clock. The clock dynamically updates every second, with the hour, minute, and second hands rotating smoothly to reflect the current time. This project is ideal for developers who want to practice building dynamic and visually appealing web applications.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: The clock updates every second, showing the current time with moving hour, minute, and second hands.
- **Smooth Animations**: The clock hands rotate smoothly, creating a realistic analog clock effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The clock is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
- **Minimalist Design**: The clock features a clean and simple design, focusing on functionality and elegance.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the webpage and the clock's layout.
- **CSS**: Applied to style the clock, including positioning the hands and adding smooth animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented to handle the clock's time calculations, update the DOM, and manage the hands' rotation.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekboadgurjar/Analog-Clock.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Analog-Clock
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    - You can either run it on a local server or simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. **Open the website** in a web browser.
2. **Watch the clock** as it displays the current time with a smooth animation of the hour, minute, and second hands.
